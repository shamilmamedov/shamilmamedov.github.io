    - title: Visiting Researcher
      institution: RWTH Aachen University, Germany
      year: Feb 2023 - May 2023
      description:
        During my research stay in Sebastian Trimpe's group, I collaborated closely with Sebastian Trimpe and Rene Geist on the modeling of deformable linear objects, including ropes, cables, and long rods. Our work focused on the development of an interpretable model that merges concepts from the rigid finite element method with data-driven deep recurrent models.

  contents:
    - title: Physics informed machine learning
      items: 
        - Combining constituent physics model and function approximators for modeling complex physics such as flexible and deformable objects
    - title: Safe learning control
      items:
        - Model-based controllers like MPC perform well provided good model but they are computationaly heavy for many application. Can we approximate them while providing safety guarantees?
