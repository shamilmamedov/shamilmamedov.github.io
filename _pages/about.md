Hello and welcome to my website. I am Shamil, a PhD student at <a href='https://www.kuleuven.be/kuleuven'>KU Leuven</a> supervised by [Jan Swevers](https://www.kuleuven.be/wieiswie/en/person/00015548).  I am currently researching model-based methods to enable robots to manipulate deformable objects such as clothes, ropes, cables, and more in both industrial and home settings. More broadly, I am passionate about robot learning for manipulation tasks.

<!-- In 2024, I did 6-month internship at Amazon Robotics in Germany, where I worked on classical robotics (integrating perception and motion planning) and reinforcement learning solutions for contact-rich manipulation of items within constrained environments.  -->

Before beginning my PhD, I collaborated with some incredibly talented researchers at Innopolis University. I worked with [Anton Shiriaev](https://www.ntnu.edu/employees/anton.shiriaev) and Ramil Khusainov on underactuated robotics projects, and with [Alexander Klimchik](https://staff.lincoln.ac.uk/bd4f1364-7872-4f53-936f-9bdb21e29fed) on improving the accuracy of robot-based machining operations.
