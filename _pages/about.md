Welcome to my personal website. My name is Shamil and I am grateful for the opportunity to share my journey and passion for robotics with you.

As a PhD student at <a href='https://www.kuleuven.be/kuleuven'>KU Leuven</a>, I have the privilege of being supervised by [Jan Swevers](https://www.kuleuven.be/wieiswie/en/person/00015548). With their guidance, I am focusing my research on developing methods for enabling robots to manipulate deformable objects such as clothes, ropes, cables, and more in both industrial and home settings.

I have had the chance to work with and learn from some talented researchers at Innopolis University, including [Anton Shiriaev](https://www.ntnu.edu/employees/anton.shiriaev) and Ramil Khusainov on projects related underactuated robotics, and [Alexander Klimchik](https://staff.lincoln.ac.uk/bd4f1364-7872-4f53-936f-9bdb21e29fed) on projects related to deformation in machining operations.

Through this website, I hope to share my experiences, thoughts, and insights with others who share my passion for robotics and its potential to transform our world. Thank you for visiting and I look forward to connecting with you
